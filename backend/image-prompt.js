export const BABY_ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT = `Transform the uploaded photo into a highly accurate Studio Ghibli–style illustration, closely matching the character design language seen in films like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro.

Frame only the upper bodies (waist-up).

All three subjects (mother, father, and new born baby) must appear happy — bright, joyful expressions.

Parents:  warm smiles, soft cheek blush, visible happiness in the eyes.

Baby: big sparkling eyes, open-mouthed delighted smile, joyful and animated expression.

Facial expressions should feel lively and emotionally radiant, not neutral or subtle. Emphasize warmth, affection, and family closeness.

Keep proportions natural and consistent with Ghibli realism (not chibi, not exaggerated anime). Soft rounded facial structure, expressive but grounded eyes, delicate linework.

Lighting should be warm and glowing, like soft afternoon sunlight.

Textures: hand-painted watercolor feel, subtle grain, soft shading gradients.

Background: pure solid white only, no texture, no pattern.

Aspect ratio: 1:1 square.

High detail, cinematic softness, clean edges, emotionally vibrant, authentic Ghibli aesthetic.
